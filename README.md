# Authentication and Testing Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **Authentication and Testing**. During this sprint, you studied **authentication, JSON web tokens, unit testing, and backend testing**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **a dad jokes app**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. All projects will be submitted to Codegrade for automated review. You will also be given feedback by code reviewers on Monday following the challenge submission. For more information on the review process [click here.](https://www.notion.so/bloomtech/How-to-View-Feedback-in-CodeGrade-c5147cee220c4044a25de28bcb6bb54a)

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge.

## Project Setup

- [ ] Run `npm install` to install your dependencies.
- [ ] Build your database executing `npm run migrate`.
- [ ] Run tests locally executing `npm test`.

## Project Instructions

Dad jokes are all the rage these days! In this challenge, you will build a real wise-guy application.

Users must be able to call the `[POST] /api/auth/register` endpoint to create a new account, and the `[POST] /api/auth/login` endpoint to get a token.

We also need to make sure nobody without the token can call `[GET] /api/jokes` and gain access to our dad jokes.

We will hash the user's password using `bcryptjs`, and use JSON Web Tokens and the `jsonwebtoken` library.

### MVP

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements (further instructions are found inside each file):

- [x] An authentication workflow with functionality for account creation and login, implemented inside `api/auth/auth-router.js`.
- [x] Middleware used to restrict access to resources from non-authenticated requests, implemented inside `api/middleware/restricted.js`.
- [x] A minimum of 2 tests per API endpoint, written inside `api/server.test.js`.

**IMPORTANT Notes:**

- Do not exceed 2^8 rounds of hashing with `bcryptjs`.
- If you use environment variables make sure to provide fallbacks in the code (e.g. `process.env.SECRET || "shh"`).
- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries. Do not update existing packages.
- The database already has the `users` table, but if you run into issues, the migration is available.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing.

## Submission format

- [ ] Submit via Codegrade by pushing commits to your `main` branch on Github.
- [ ] Check Codegrade before the deadline to compare its results against your local tests.
- [ ] Check Codegrade on the days following the Sprint Challenge for reviewer feedback.
- [ ] New commits will be evaluated by Codegrade if pushed _before_ the sprint challenge deadline.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics.

1. Differences between using _sessions_ or _JSON Web Tokens_ for authentication.

Session are stored on the server and passed in requests through session cookies. While a user is logged in, the cookie is sent to the server with every request.
This allows the server to compare the session id from the cookie against the information that is stored in memory to verify the users credentials, it then sends
a response with the state.

JSON Web Tokens contain a header, a payload, and a signature. The header contains the algorithm with the token type, the payload contains data we want to store in the token like permissions, and the signature is created by an encoded string with the header and payload together, then signed with a secret. All three parts creates a JWT.

2. What does `bcryptjs` do to help us store passwords in a secure manner?

It allows us to hash passwords, and determine how many rounds of hashing we want to perform which makes it harder for hackers to obtain the data.

3. How are unit tests different from integration and end-to-end testing?

Unit tests test a singular unit of code and are faster and easier to write because they focus on small sections of code at a time. Integration tests how different components are able to work together.
and End to end tests the entire application from beginning to end and would mimick how the user would use the application.

4. How does _Test Driven Development_ change the way we write applications and tests?

Test driven development is where you write the tests first and the the code. You focus on the outcome of the code, and then write the code accordingly.
